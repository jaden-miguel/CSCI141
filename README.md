# WWU CSCI141
CSCI141: Computer Programming I

* Intended for students majoring in computer science. Basic concepts of computer programming using an object oriented programming language. Topics covered: introduction to the development environment, introduction to algorithms, elements of a programming language, including data types, packages, control structures, procedures and functions, basic input and output, arrays and records, text files, strings, variant records. Algorithm development, problem solving and software engineering are emphasized. Programming is required in implementation of concepts.

On completion of this course students will demonstrate:

* a basic understanding of the concepts of the use of a programming language in problem solving, including language control structures, functions, basic input and output operations and one-dimensional arrays.
* a basic understanding of algorithm development and problem solving techniques.
* the use of a modern programming language for simple problem solving in the imperative execution model.
* the ability to use the Linux operating system in laboratory exercises.
* the ability to create test cases for simple programming problems.
